  Lily flowers are valued for their large, very showy, often fragrant flowers. The 6 plain or strikingly marked tepals (petals) are often trumpet-shaped, sitting atop tall, erect stems.<br>
(Note: This page is about growing (true) lilies which belong to the genus Lilium and grow from plump, scaly bulbs. Asiatic and Oriental lilies are examples of true lilies. The daylily and<br>
 peace lily plants, despite the word (lily) in the name, are not true lilies.)
These hearty bulbs are easy to grow and require minimal care, provided that you plant them in the right place.<br>
At home in both formal and naturalistic settings, lilies also most take readily to containers.  Plus, they all make wonderful cut flowers!
By carefully blending early, mid-season, and late varieties into your garden, you will enjoy their magnificent blooms from spring through frost.
