  The roses are shrubs or scandent shrubs, cultivated or wild. Theirs stems are often armed with prickles, their leaves are composed and theirs flowers are more or less fragrant and multicolor.<br>
They belong to the genus Rosa, within the family Rosaceae. They are native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.<br>
The botanical classification of indigenous roses includes 150 species in the genus Rosa. Over the course of time, however, natural and spontaneous crosses have been produced and have created many<br>
hybrids. In addition, man has intervened since the 19th century : species and natural hybrids have been used to obtain yet more new varieties, called cultivars (from cultivated varieties).<br>
Today, there are many species of rose... and several thousand varieties !
