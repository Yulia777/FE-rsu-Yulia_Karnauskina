Lilies have been associated with many ancient myths, and pictures of lilies were discovered in a villa in Crete, dating back to the Minoan Period, about 1580 B.C.<br>
Lilies are mentioned in the Old Testament, and in the New Testament, they symbolize chastity and virtue.
In both the Christian and pagan traditions, the lily is a fertility symbol.<br>
In Greek marriage ceremonies the bride wears a crown of lilies and wheat implying purity and abundance.
